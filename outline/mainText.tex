\section{Introduction}

Operating systems (OSes) are specialised, low level software that manages a computer's
resources and provides a common interface for programs. The most common operating
systems used by most consumers today include MacOS and Windows. Xv6 is an operating
system written by MIT for the purposes of teaching [\iffalse TODO: add ref \fi].
As it is meant to be a teaching OS, it has very barebones functionality,
which includes a command line shell and some basic user programs by default.

\section{Aims, Objectives and Deliverables}

\subsection{Project Aims}

The aim of this project is to implement graphics support for Xv6. This includes
adding: basic PCIe support and driver for the graphics card, a simple interface
for user programs to draw to the screen, and possibly a grid window manager
to make use of Xv6's multicore CPU support.

\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Implement basic PCIe support to detect and setup the QEMU standard VGA card}
    \item{Implement a driver for the VGA card to access registers and the framebuffer}
    \item{Implement a library to abstract away the intricacies of drawing to the screen and provide a basic interface to set pixels and draw shape primitives}
    \item{(optional) Implement a grid window manager so multiple graphical user applications can run simultaneously}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Deliverables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Git repository containing source code for:}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item{Kernel PCIe configuration}
              \item{VGA driver}
              \item{Simple userland graphics library}
              \item{(optional) Grid window manager}
              \item{Example user programs}
          \end{itemize}
    \item{Demo video showcasing graphics implementation}
    \item{Final Report}
\end{itemize}

\section{Risk Mitigation}

Risks for this project are minor. Unexpected delays when implementing some of the
planned features are the only real risk, which is managed by splitting the project
into milestones with liberal estimates on the timeframes. If an issue arises that
severely impacts the time needed to complete the project, certain features can be
excluded such as the grid layout window manager.
