% Motivation / Introduction

\section{Introduction}

<A brief overview of your project suitable for a non-specialised audience. You may mention background and motivation, but should avoid technical terms as far as possible. 1-2 paragraphs should be sufficient. Here is an example of how to cite a reference \cite{parikh1980adaptive}.>

% Aims, Objectives and deliverables.
%
\section{Aims, Objectives and Delievarables}

\subsection{Project Aims}

<A brief summary of the primary aims of this project. Typically 1-3 sentences.>

\subsection{Objectives}

<A list of what you want to achieve {\em by the end of the project} -- note this means `learn how to\ldots', `research into\ldots` are {\em not} objectives, as they are intermediate milestones rather than final goals. All objectives should be measurable, {\em i.e.} it should be possible to provide evidence to confirm whether or not they have been achieved. 3-5 objectives is typical.>

\subsection{Deliverables}

<A list of what you will hand in at the end of the project. This will include the final report (possibly spread across multiple deliverables, if that makes sense for your project), code (possibly more than one version), and so on. Ideally the deliverables should be cross-referenced to the objectives. 2-3 deliverables is typical, but there can be more depending on the nature of the project.>


%
% Plan
%
\section{Project Plan}

<Provide a plan for the full project, from when you started until the submission of the final report. This should discuss the key stages of your project.>

\subsection{Timeline}

<A graphical description of your plan, often as a Gantt chart.>

% To include a figure, uncomment and modify the following. Vary the 'width'
% field until it looks suitable. This uses the 'graphicx' module that has
% already been included in 'config.tex'.

%
% Ethics.
%
\section{Ethics}

<If your project has ethical issues (e.g. gathering of user consent forms), then you should state here how you intend to address them. If there are no ethical issues then explicitly state: "There are no ethical issues for this project.">
